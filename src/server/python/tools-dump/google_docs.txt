{"name":"google_docs-edit","label":"Edit Google Doc","description":"Use this tool to propose an edit to a Google Doc in the user's browser.\n\nThis will be read by a less intelligent model, which will quickly apply the edit by splitting it into per-paragraph suggestions. You should make it clear what the edit is, while also minimizing the unchanged text you write.\n\nWhen writing the edit, you should specify each edit in sequence, with the special comment `// ... existing text ...` to represent unchanged text in between edited lines. You should reference paragraph tags for context.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n// ... existing text ...\n<paragraph page_id=2 paragraph_id=5>\nFIRST_EDIT_TEXT\n</paragraph>\n// ... existing text ...\n<paragraph page_id=2 paragraph_id=7>\nSECOND_EDIT_TEXT\n</paragraph>\n// ... existing text ...\n```\n\nYou should bias towards repeating as few lines of the original document as possible to convey the change, but sufficient to resolve ambiguity.\nEach edit should contain sufficient context of unchanged lines around the text you're editing to resolve ambiguity.\nDO NOT omit spans of pre-existing text without using the `// ... existing text ...` comment to indicate its absence.\nMake sure it is clear what the edit should be, and where it should be applied by referencing the paragraph tags from the original document.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure not to mistakenly combine multiple paragraphs into a single <paragraph> tag. Each paragraph in the original document has its own unique paragraph_id and must be written separately. You may make edits to many paragraphs in one call, but make sure to follow the <paragraph> blocks for each paragraph with their correct page_id and paragraph_id values.\n\nThe page content contains <page> and <paragraph> tags with page_id and paragraph_id attributes - these IDs should never be inferred from other tools' results. For reference (which may or may not be relevant), the user's current selected text is indicated by <selected_text> tag and cursor position is indicated by [USER_CURSOR], but you should ignore these when generating the edit content as this should not be inserted into the document.","inputSchema":{"jsonSchema":{"type":"object","properties":{"tabId":{"type":"string","description":"The browser tab ID where the Google Docs document is open"},"start_location":{"type":"object","properties":{"page_id":{"type":"number"},"paragraph_id":{"type":"number"}},"required":["page_id","paragraph_id"],"additionalProperties":false,"description":"Approximate starting location of the edit block"},"end_location":{"type":"object","properties":{"page_id":{"type":"number"},"paragraph_id":{"type":"number"}},"required":["page_id","paragraph_id"],"additionalProperties":false,"description":"Approximate ending location of the edit block"},"instructions":{"type":"string","description":"A concise explanation of what the edit accomplishes"},"content":{"type":"string","description":"Specify ONLY the precise lines of text that you wish to edit. **NEVER specify or write out unchanged text**.
